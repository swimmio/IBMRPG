title: Data Handling in ArrayList
---
This document will delve into how the ArrayList in the IBMRPG repository handles different types of data. We'll cover:

1. The general concept of an ArrayList in Java
2. How ArrayList handles different data types in Java

# The general concept of an ArrayList in Java

An ArrayList in Java is a resizable array, which can be found in the java.util package. It provides us with dynamic arrays in Java. The ArrayList class extends AbstractList and implements the List interface. ArrayList supports dynamic arrays that can grow as needed. Unlike the standard array class in Java, an ArrayList is more flexible as it can adjust its size dynamically.

# How ArrayList handles different data types in Java

ArrayList in Java can handle different types of data because it is a generic class, meaning it can take any data type as a parameter. This is done by using Java Generics. When creating an ArrayList, you can specify the type of elements it will hold in angle brackets. For example, `ArrayList<String>` will hold Strings, `ArrayList<Integer>` will hold Integers, and so on. If no type is specified, the ArrayList will hold objects of type Object, which is the superclass of all classes in Java. This allows for flexibility in handling different types of data.

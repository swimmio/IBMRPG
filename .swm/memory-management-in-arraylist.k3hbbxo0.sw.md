title: Memory Management in ArrayList
---
This document will delve into the topic of how the ArrayList component in the IBMRPG repository manages memory. We will cover:

1. The general concept of memory management in Java's ArrayList.
2. How this concept is applied in the ArrayList component of the IBMRPG repository.

# General concept of memory management in Java's ArrayList

In Java, an ArrayList is a resizable array, which can grow or shrink dynamically. When elements are added to an ArrayList, it manages memory by automatically resizing itself. Initially, an ArrayList has a certain capacity (default is 10). When this capacity is exceeded, the ArrayList automatically grows by 50% of its current size. Conversely, when elements are removed and the ArrayList is significantly larger than the number of elements it contains, it can be manually trimmed to size to free up memory.

# Application in the ArrayList component of the IBMRPG repository

Unfortunately, without specific context from the repository, we cannot provide a detailed explanation on how the ArrayList component in the IBMRPG repository manages memory. However, it is likely that it follows the general principles of memory management in Java's ArrayList as described above.

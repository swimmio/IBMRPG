title: Opportunities for Optimization and Extension in Utils Functions
---
This document will cover the potential for optimizing or extending the utility functions in the IBMRPG repository. We'll cover:

1. The current state of utility functions
2. Potential areas for optimization
3. Opportunities for extending functionality.

# Current State of Utility Functions

The `UTILS.RPGLE` file contains the utility functions used in the repository. These functions are fundamental to the operation of the other components in the repository.

# Potential Areas for Optimization

The `ARRAYLIST.RPGLE` file contains the implementation of the ArrayList collection. The for loop iterating over the array size could potentially be optimized for performance.

# Opportunities for Extending Functionality

The `HASHMAP.RPGLE` file contains the implementation of the HashMap collection. There could be opportunities to extend the functionality of this collection, such as adding new methods or improving existing ones.
